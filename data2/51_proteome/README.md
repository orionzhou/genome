## Construction of the B73-Mo17 proteome database

* B73 proteome (AGPv4)
  * 131,585 total transcript isoforms (39,351 protein-coding genes)
  * 98,829 non-redundant protein sequences
* Mo17 resequencing variant calling
  * [6.3M high quality SNPs](https://github.com/orionzhou/reseq/blob/master/data/35_vnt_ase/vt01.stats.tsv) were used to predict protein sequence change
  * 49,150 new protein sequences were added (to the B73 proteome)
* [Mo17 genome assembly]()
  * 46,530 transcript isoforms (38,620 protein coding genes)
  * 27,433 new protein sequences were added
* The final [B73-Mo17 proteome database](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aVBlxGCNx5Cn4ObbCsK4LUPBme6fOn6S) contains:
  * 175,412 non-redundant protein sequences
