Maize UniformMu mutants characterization
================
November 02, 2018





































Raw GFF3 file mapping to B73 AGPv3 were obtained from maizeGDB - 79,407
insertion sites and related stocks information

Insertion sites were lifted over to AGPv4 - 77,085 sites

The overlap of these sites with AGPv4 exons were checked: - 36,648 sites
overlap w. at least one exon(s) - 38,778 sites do not overlap w. an exon
(i.e., either in introns, UTRs or intergenic spaces)

A total of 14,831 genes have at least one exonic insertion sites, 9,046
have at least two exonic insertions.

    insertion sites.
